A curated collection of **103 specialized AI agent skills** originally designed for [Antigravity](https://antigravity.dev), but fully compatible with **Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Codex, Aider**, and any other agentic AI assistants. Skills cover the full engineering stack — from data engineering to frontend development to financial analysis.

## 🎯 Design Principles

- **Progressive Disclosure** — `AGENTS.md` → `README.md` → `SKILL.md` → `references/`
- **Token Efficiency** — Core skill files stay lean; heavy content lives in `references/`
- **agentskills.io Compliant** — Follows the open standard for agent skill packages
- **Intent Gate** — Every request is classified before action (Trivial / Explicit / Exploratory / Open-ended / Ambiguous)

## 🚀 Usage

### Prerequisites
- Any agentic assistant compatible with markdown-based instruction protocols (e.g., [Antigravity](https://antigravity.dev), [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), Codex, or [Smithery](https://smithery.ai)).

### Installation
1. Copy the `.agents/` directory into your project root.
2. Copy `AGENTS.md` to your project root (acts as the main rule/routing file for your AI).
3. Your AI agent will automatically detect the registry and route your natural language requests to the appropriate skill.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome additions to the library! To maintain our token efficiency and structural integrity:
1. Trigger the `skill-writer` agent skill to help you draft the new skill conforming to our conventions.
2. Ensure the `SKILL.md` is strictly **under 250 lines**. Place any dense reference material in a `references/` subdirectory.
3. Register the new skill by updating the `skills_count` and `skill_categories` inside `.agents/plugin.json`.
4. Update this `README.md` and `.agents/skills/README.md` to reflect the new counts.

## 📋 Conventions

See `docs/` for detailed guides:
- `implementation-protocol.md` — Pre-implementation checks & verification
- `communication-style.md` — Agent communication standards (includes Caveman mode)
- `rtk-optimization.md` — Token compression (60-90% reduction)
- `comment-policy.md` — When comments are acceptable

The following **skills** also act as foundational project conventions:
- `clean-code` — Pragmatic coding standards (SRP, DRY, KISS, YAGNI)
- `git-workflow` — Repository standards for commits, branches, and PRs
- `tdd` — Test-Driven Development lifecycle (Red-Green-Refactor)
- `git-guardrails-claude-code` — Safety conventions preventing destructive git operations
